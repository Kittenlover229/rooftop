    <p class="author">Artur Roos (aka. Kittenlover)</p>
    This is my personal space and rather minimalistic online presence. This
    website includes a blog, a listing of my personal projects, my up-to-date CV
    and else. I do programming and contract work. Currently an active IB Student.
    Located in Joensuu, North Karelia, Finland. Fluent in English (IELTS C1).
    My spare time is spent learning about programming
    languages and linguistics in general, hacking away at my pet-projects, cooking,
    gaming and sometimes reading. Experienced in C/C++ and Python3.X, interested in Rust.
    I use arch btw.
